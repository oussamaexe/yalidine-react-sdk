## Code Style

- Write TypeScript (not plain JS)
- Let ESLint and Prettier handle formatting
- Write commit messages that make sense
- Add comments for stuff that isn't obvious

- Make sure everything passes before submitting
- Try to keep coverage above 70% if you can

## Before You Submit

1. Update the README if you added something new
2. Check that tests pass: `npm test`
3. Check that linting is happy: `npm run lint`
4. Write a quick description of what your PR does
